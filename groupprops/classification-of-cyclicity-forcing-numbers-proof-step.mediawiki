===(4) implies (3)===

'''Given''': A group <math>G</math>, whose order is <math>n = p_1p_2 \dots p_r</math>, where the <math>p_i</math> are distinct primes and <math>p_i</math> does not divide <math>p_j - 1</math> for <math>i \ne j</math>.

'''To prove''': <math>G</math> is cyclic.

'''Proof''': We prove this claim by induction on <math>n</math>. First, note that any divisor of <math>n</math> also satisfies the condition of being square-free as well as the condition that no prime divisor of it divides any other prime divisor minus one.

'''Base case of induction''': The base case of induction, <math>n = 1</math>, is trivial.

'''Proof of inductive step''':

| 1 || Every proper subgroup of <math>G</math> is cyclic || Fact (6) || inductive hypothesis, arithmetic condition on <math>n</math> || || <toggledisplay>Every proper subgroup of <math>G</math> has order <math>d</math>, for some divisor <math>d</math> of <math>n</math> (by Lagrange's theorem, Fact (6)). <math>d</math> is square-free and satisfies the condition that for prime divisors <math>p,q</math> of <math>d</math>, <math>p</math> does not divide <math>q - 1</math>. Further, <math>d < n</math>, so by the inductive hypothesis, every group of order <math>d</math> is cyclic, so the given subgroup is cyclic.</toggledisplay>

| 2 || If <math>G</math> is abelian, then <math>G</math> is cyclic || || <math>n</math> is square-free || || <toggledisplay>If <math>G</math> is abelian, it is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Since <math>n</math> is square-free, each of the Sylow subgroups is of prime order, hence cyclic, so <math>G</math> is cyclic.</toggledisplay>

| 3 || If <math>G</math> is non-abelian, <math>G</math> is not simple || Fact (2) || || Step (1) || <toggledisplay>By Step (1), every proper subgroup of <math>G</math> is cyclic, hence it is abelian. Thus, Fact (2) applies.</toggledisplay>

| 4 || Any proper normal subgroup of <math>G</math> is central || Fact (4) || For any two prime divisors <math>p_i, p_j</math> of <math>n</math>, <math>p_i</math> does not divide <math>p_j - 1</math> || Step (1) || <toggledisplay>Suppose <math>N</math> is a proper normal subgroup of <math>G</math> of order <math>d</math>. Then, by Step (1), we know that <math>N</math> is cyclic.<br>Thus, the automorphism group of <math>N</math> has order equal to the [[Euler totient function]] of the order of <math>N</math>. This order is <math>\prod_{p_i|d} (p_i - 1)</math>.</br>Further, we have a homomorphism from <math>G</math> to <math>\operatorname{Aut}(N)</math> given by the action by conjugation. By the assumption on <math>n</math>, we see that the orders of <math>G</math> is relatively prime to the order of <math>\operatorname{Aut}(N)</math>, so by Fact (4), the homomorphism is trivial. In other words, every element of <math>G</math> acts trivially on <math>N</math> by conjugation.<br>Thus, <math>N</math> is contained in the center of <math>G</math>.</toggledisplay>

| 5 || If <math>G</math> is non-abelian, the center <math>Z(G)</math> of <math>G</math> is nontrivial || || || Steps (3), (4) || <toggledisplay>Since <math>G</math> is non-abelian, it is in partciular nontrivial. By Step (3), it is not simple, so it has a proper normal subgroup. By Step (4), this is in the center. Therefore, the center of <math>G</math> is nontrivial.</toggledisplay>

| 6 || If <math>G</math> is non-abelian, the quotient <math>G/Z(G)</math> is cyclic || Fact (7) || inductive hypothesis || Step (5) || <toggledisplay>The order of the quotient group is a divisor of the order of <math>G</math> (Fact (7)), and it is a ''proper'' divisor because the center is nontrivial (Step (5)). Hence by the inductive hypothesis, it must be cyclic.</toggledisplay>

| 7 || <math>G</math> is abelian || Fact (5) || || Step (6) || <toggledisplay>If <math>G</math> is non-abelian, then <math>G/Z(G)</math> is cyclic by the previous step. By Fact (5), we know that any subgroup that is cyclic over the center of <math>G</math> is Abelian, so we obtain that <math>G</math> itself is Abelian. Thus, we find that even starting with the assumption that <math>G</math> is non-abelian yields that <math>G</math> is Abelian, so <math>G</math> must always be abelian.</toggledisplay>
