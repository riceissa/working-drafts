| [[dissatisfies metaproperty::transitive subgroup property]] || No || [[isomorph-freeness is not transitive]] || || It is possible to have groups <math>H \le K \le G</math> such that <math>H</math> is isomorph-free in <math>K</math> and <math>K</math> is isomorph-free in <math>G</math> but <math>H</math> is not isomorph-free in <math>G</math>.
|-
| [[satisfies metaproperty::transitive subgroup property]] || Yes || [[isomorph-freeness is quotient-transitive]] || || Suppose <math>H \le K \le G</math> are groups such that <math>H</math> is isomorph-free in <math>G</math> and the [[quotient group]] <math>K/H</math> is isomorph-free in <math>G/H</math>. Then, <math>K</math> is isomorph-free in <math>G</math>.
|-
| [[dissatisfies metaproperty::finite-intersection-closed subgroup property]] || No || [[isomorph-freeness is not finite-intersection-closed]] || It is possible to have a group <math>G</math> and subgroups <math>H, K</math> of <math>G</math> such that <math>H</math> and <math>K</math> are both isomorph-free but the [[intersection of subgroups|intersection]] <math>H \cap K</math> is not isomorph-free.
|-
| [[satisfies metaproperty::strongly join-closed subgroup property]] || Yes || [[isomorph-freeness is strongly join-closed]] || || Suppose <math>H_i, i \in I</math> are subgroups of a group <math>G</math> such that each <math>H_i</math> is an isomorph-free subgroup of <math>G</math>. Then, the [[join of subgroups]] <math>\left \langle H_i \right \rangle_{i \in I}</math> is also an isomorph-free subgroup of <math>G</math>.
|-
| [[dissatisfies metaproperty::finite-upper join-closed subgroup property]] || No || || It is possible to have groups <math>H \le G</math> and <math>K,L</math> are intermediate subgroups such that <math>H</math> is isomorph-free in both <math>K</math> and <math>L</math>, but <math>H</math> is not isomorph-free in <math>\langle K, L \rangle</math>. || [[Isomorph-freeness is not upper join-closed]]
|-
| [[satisfies metaproperty::trivially true subgroup property]] || Yes || || || The trivial subgroup is isomorph-free in any group.
|-
| [[dissatisfies metaproperty::identity-true subgroup property]] || No || || || It is possible for a group to be isomorphic to a subgroup of itself. The simplest example is <math>\mathbb{Z}</math>, the [[group of integers]], that is isomorphic to the subgroup <math>n\mathbb{Z}</math> for any positive integer <math>n</math>. A group that is isomorph-free as a subgroup of itself is termed a [[co-Hopdian group]].
