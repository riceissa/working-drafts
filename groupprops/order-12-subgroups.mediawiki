=== Table of number of isomorphism  classes of subgroups ===

The number of isomorphism classes of subgroups of a given order is bounded from above by both the number of conjugacy classes of subgroups of that order and the number of isomorphism classes of all groups of that order. Moreover, if the number of conjugacy classes is positive, so is the number of isomorphism classes.
