It's been a little over eight months since my last blog post for <em>Open Borders: The Case</em>. Part of my absence is explained by me having a number of other obligations (work and other personal matters). However, I continue to seek to understand migration using the radical lens that I have previously adopted on this site. I have spent a lot of effort doing so over the past few months, and expect to continue spending effort on this. In this post, I explain a little more of my changed focus.

<h4>Meeting real human needs</h4>

<em>Open Borders: The Case</em> did a good job, back in its day, of being one of the few places on the Internet where one could get a reasonable overview of the case for freedom of movement, as well as dig into some of the nuances. And freedom of movement is a real human need. That is the reason I worked on the site at the outset, and that is the reason I continue to be interested in the topic. Nonetheless, the site itself does not meet a large enough human need to feel like something critical to users. If the website were shut down today (which won't happen!) some people might miss it for a while, but few will find critical life functions threatened.

Contrast this with other websites that touch on migration issues. Websites of immigration law firms serve a clear human need: they help people with immigration issues get in touch with lawyers. Other law websites that cover migration issues help people navigate the immigration bureaucracy. The Immigration Policy Center is a mainstream immigrant advocacy group, but in addition to its advocacy, it also serves a valuable function explaining and commenting on different aspects of immigration law and immigration enforcement. The same goes for the National Immigration Law Center and National Immigrant Justice Center. On the restrictionist side, the Center for Immigration Studies has insightful commentary and analysis of the <em>status quo</em> of immigration enforcement in the United States from a restrictionist viewpoint.

I believe this is one area where <em>Open Borders: The Case</em> has fallen short. Partly, it is just because we are a small site, not a fully funded operation. But more importantly, it is because the space of ideas we explore is so far removed from the <em>status quo</em> that we just don't engage with current realities in ways that people with real, pressing problems today can relate to, or work off. While we have explored various aspects of the <em>status quo</em>, it is primarily to use them perfunctorily as examples to discuss broader issues (even these limited efforts are due mainly to my co-blogger John Lee, whom I credit for exploring immigration law in depth before I came to understand the importance of such exploration).

<h4>Knowing, and sounding like we know, what we're talking about</h4>

The more radical your ideas, the more critical it is that you know what you're talking about, and make this clear to others. Here again, I believe <em>Open Borders: The Case</em> has not lived up to its potential. We have championed radical ideas, and laid out plausible arguments for them. But by not engaging with the details of the <em> status quo</em>, by not internalizing these and animating our discussion with them, we are relinquishing the opportunity to offer value in the <em>status quo</em>.

<h4>My plan</h4>

Over the last several months, my plan has been to better master various aspects of migration law, worldwide, with a special focus on the origins of immigration restrictions as well as the current state of migration law, starting with the United States and gradually extending to other countries. Most of this is law I was vaguely familiar with but hadn't grasped the nuances of. Previously, my knowledge was minimalistic, based on what I need to know either to personally functionor to evaluate specific things I was writing or reading about. So, for instance, I would be satisfied to know, vaguely, that there is a H-1B lottery and an annual cycle and there are some exempt slots for Masters degree holders. I would be happy to know that there are wait times for green cards and these wait times differ by country. I was happy to know that the H-1B is for "skilled workers." Now, this level of understanding no longer satisfies me. I feel the need to be prepared when I read a labor advocate say that the H-1B is indentured labor, or I read the CIS say that H-1B workers are not all that highly skilled, while also hearing about skills shortages. 

When I hear claims that immigrants can never be denied welfare benefits, versus claims that immigrants are already denied welfare benefits, I don't want to have to do on-the-spot research to pull up numbers: I should have a good mental model of the current reality and an explanation of why people see such different truths in the same reality.

One of the criteria is that very little that I read should surprise me, or feel new, and the fact that something surprises me and feels new should itself surprise me. I should have a sufficiently clear grasp of the situation 

There are philosophical priors, there are economic principles, there are perspectives where we can draw conclusions without looking at specific details. But to actually give depth and sincerity to one's conclusions, going through the details matters.

<h4>Engaging reality does not necessitate mainstreaming</h4>

Engaging reality does put radical views to the test.

If a radical view is actually true, it should survive that contact with reality.

Diving into details doesn't make you a sellout.

But it is important to remember the Stockhol syndrome of morally normalizing any system one immerses oneself in, and to consciously remind oneself to examine the system at every turn.
