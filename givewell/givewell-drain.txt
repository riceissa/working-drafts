I'm posting this here primarily so that others can offer their frank thoughts without the signaling/posturing implications of opining on the issue in a public forum (usual caveats apply: please don't say anything that you would feel bad about being associated with publicly).

Holden Karnofsky recently posted an April Fool's joke on the GiveWell blog at http://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/01/seeking-feedback-on-alternative-more-persuasion-oriented-potential-format-for-evidence-reviews/ Quick recap: GiveWell is a reputable charity evaluator that, in 2015, moved over $100 million in money, $70 million of it from Good Ventures and $33 million from other donors. GiveWell also has a to-be-spun-off project called the Open Philanthropy Project, and together employ 30 people. Holden Karnofsky is co-executive director of GiveWell. His posts on the official GiveWell blog (that are circulated internally within the org and are supposed to be vetted by many trained eyes before being released to the wider world) can affect the lives of many people (employees, donors, recipients) and influence public perception of GiveWell's and Open Phil's brand of philanthropy.

To give a little more context to Karnofsky's post, it comes at a time when the main GiveWell blog has not had any substantive posts for the last two months (since the last week of January, there have been four posts: two linking to Open Phil posts, one an open thread, and one saying they would love to get on phone calls with donors). The annual review, which is usually published in February and March, has not yet been published, and there have been no blog announcements even acknowleding the delay. (Open Phil's blog has had four substantive posts in the last two months). We are therefore talking of an organization that appears to be either crushed by other kinds of work at present or not interested in public outreach through the blog.

When, this morning, I saw a new post on the GiveWell blog discussing experimentation with new, effective forms of outreach, I was initially hopeful. Could this be the reason that GiveWell has been silent for two months? That they are working on improving their (currently not-very-informative) charity reviews to better meet the needs of people who are interested in donating? Perhaps this ambitious and so-far-unannounced project explains the long silence? I clicked through to the review, hoping against hope that it was not an April Fool's Joke, but then was surprised to see a very short review making sweeping statements that don't even pass a laugh test. After confirming that this was indeed an April Fool's Joke, I tried to think: what could be the purpose of this? What does this reveal about the mentality of the people who propagated it?

To me, it seems problematic on many levels:

- It shows how uncharitably GiveWell views other outreach efforts, in that the efforts to mimic more user-friendly, simplified reviews and recommendations miserably fails the ideological Turing test. Until I read closely, GiveWell's simplified review looked a lot like Charity Science's in terms of structure and length. I was initially thinking: is GiveWell poking fun at Charity Science?

- It shows where GiveWell's priorities are as an organization, that this kind of project received a higher priority than even making a brief announcement of a delay in the annual review.

- It shows how little regard Karnofsky and GiveWell have for millions of dollars in potential money moved being lost on account of getting a good laugh. I know that most regular GiveWell donors won't really be affected much, but for me, it was a significant negative update. I also highly doubt that anybody who is not already sympathetic to GiveWell will read the post and like GiveWell more, and I suspect that many who do read the post will form a more negative opinion of GiveWell.

- It shows the low quality of the vetting/screening process used internally by GiveWell, that this sort of post made it through the process.

Many people will see this as a harmless joke, and claim that the above is an overreaction. I agree that it is a harmless joke to many, but not to all. Of the two other non-GiveWell-employees I discussed this with privately, neither was happy. One of them said that this post marked a point in the spiritual death of GiveWell. Another said that he found it weird and that he had a negative reaction to it.

I'll add that I am not against saying unpopular truths at the risk of alienating people, and if Karnofsky's post courted controversy in order to kickstart discussion of an important topic, I would have seen it as a risky bet. What I find galling here is that the downsides of the post have no offsetting upside.

I am interested in hearing other people's thoughts.

- Was your personal reaction to the post positive or negative?

- In what ways does this post help GiveWell's brand?

- On balance, do you expect the post's effect on GiveWell's brand to be positive or negative?

- Do you see Karnofsky's post as making valuable contributions to the space of ideas or memes?
