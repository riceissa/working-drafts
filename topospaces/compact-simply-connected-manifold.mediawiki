{{manifold property}}

==Definition==

A '''compact simply connected manifold''' is a [[manifold]] which is [[compact space|compact]] and [[simply connected space|simply connected]] as a topological space.

== Examples ==

* For <math>n \ge 2</math>, the <math>n</math>-sphere <math>S^n</math> is a compact simply connected manifold. Similarly, a product of such spheres is a compact simply connected manifold.
* The [[E8 manifold]] is an example of a compact simply connected manifold that is ''not'' a [[differentiable manifold]].

==Relation with other properties==

Note that a compact manifold that is [[contractible space|contractible]] must be the [[one-point space]]. Therefore, we cannot strengthen the condition of simple connectivity too far.
