Resumed work Monday June 27:

2:51: Copied entire nginx config structure to S3 from old machine

3:00: Cleaning up nginx for Wikipedia Views

4:00: All nginx changes synced to S3

Still trying to figure out PHP ports

4:02: Updated /etc/php/7.0/fpm/pool.d/www.conf to change the listen line to point to 127.0.0.1:9000

6:30: Installed fastcgi, following installation instructions here but replace 5 with 7 when calling the apt-get install

7:15: Figured out that one line needs to be added in fastcgi_params as discussed at http://serverfault.com/questions/502776/what-is-the-correct-setting-of-nginxs-fastcgi-param-script-filename

Also syncing all nginx changes to the S3 folder nginx-new, making configuration revert easier.

Might also git control it.

7:40: Updated DNS records, now time to just wait for it to propagate

7:47: Reduced TTL for highly accessed properties to 1 hour, so that it is easier to move them while being minimally disruptive. Plan to make TTL 5 minutes when doing migrations and then revert to 1 hour after stable again
