- Concern about elitism: chasing big money, catering to/schmoozing with billionaires, rather than being in touch with what people ultimately want

-- Even if we overall have a solid product, concern about all efforts at the margin being devoted to schmoozing/addressing the needs of the few rather than the many.
 
-- This problem is more serious for "post-facto" donations

--- Less of a problem selling to billionaire businesses, since they still need to service their own customers, so there is a feedback loop, even if indirect.

--- More of a problem with getting billionaire individuals to donate.
