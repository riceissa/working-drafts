Hi Ben,

Thanks for a really great post that contained a lot of things that I think are worth iterating. It might be worth disclosing that you have previously worked as a research analyst at GiveWell, but all views are of course your own, etc.

As is customary for Internet comments, I will dwell on a point where I think your emphasis was off.

> "Let’s talk about deworming, a star intervention among GiveWell’s top charities. I get the sense that people think there’s decisive evidence from randomized controlled trials that clearly shows that deworming charities have huge effects on life outcomes"

I'm be curious to know where you "get the sense" for this.

My impression is that while SCI and DTW are given honorary status by many self-identified EAs and other GiveWell followers as probably-effective-charities-because-GiveWell-recommends-them, this doesn't amount to anything close to a considered endorsement. If I were to look at what people were actually endorsing, I'd look at:

(1) GiveWell money moved metrics: GiveWell provided a summary in their blog post at http://blog.givewell.org/2016/05/13/givewells-money-moved-web-traffic-2015/ that I further discussed at http://effective-altruism.com/r/main/ea/xn/givewell_money_moved_in_2015_a_review_of_my/ As you can see from GiveWell's summary, and as I discuss more in my post, the two main charities that get the bulk of non-Good Ventures money (about 90%) are GiveDirectly and AMF. As I also explain in my post, we should apply the caveat to money moved that most money is moved by big donors. So it may be that in terms of number of donors per charity (which GiveWell doesn't release) GiveDirectly and AMF don't reach 90%. But if you think of money moved as the strength of endorsement, then 90% is a reasonable conclusion.

(2) Public announcements of charity donations: If you look at GiveWell staff members' personal donations, you'll see that none of them are donating to SCI. In fact, SCI isn't even mentioned in the body of the post! What about people outside GiveWell? Most of the fundraisers I heard of during Giving Season were associated with AMF. Charity Science's page lists three areas: cash transfers, bed nets, and deworming, but their donate page for deworming seems to go to Deworm the World's page, and not to SCI. In fact I don't recall reading any ringing endorsement of SCI, or any discussion at all of SCI as a charity that might be worth donating to.

Given all this evidence, it's not very clear that either GiveWell donors or Effective Altruists had a clear and favorable impression of SCI, or even any impression at all beyond probably-good-but-haven't-looked-into-it, which is a reasonably okay first impression to have of something that you don't intend to investigate or act upon further.

This does still leave open the question of whether GiveWell made a reasonable estimate of the uncertainties around deworming and SCI prior to July 2016, and whether it did a good job of communicating. This was a question Issa Rice raised at http://blog.givewell.org/2016/06/20/weve-learned-sci-year/#comment-939692 and I would tentatively say that GiveWell did mispredict or miscommunicate on this issue to some extent. Part of this, I think, stemmed from GiveWell not being sufficiently quantitative about how big its communication gap with SCI might be (i.e., although I had read their previous reports, I would not have thought based on those that GiveWell would find it totally expected that $330,000 in grant money would be unaccounted for). Regardless, I think that whatever issues there were, these didn't have a huge effect since most people ended up neither donating to nor advocating for SCI.
