Now that this thread has mostly concluded, I thought I'd weigh in on the most constructive possible next steps.

I think Gleb's behavior, while regrettable in some ways, is not that far out of the norms set both within the EA community and in the world at large. Rather than simply cataloguing his excesses and misdeeds, I propose a more constructive next step, both to limit any further negative interaction for this particular case and to avoid other people getting into this sort of trouble.

My proposal is that Jeff (or whoever else wants) write a blog post with a set of ideas and guidelines around disclosure of institutional and financial affiliation, use of numbers or statistics in marketing, use of social proof, etc. These guidelines obviously cannot (and will not) be binding on anybody but they will help people understand Jeff's thinking around the boundaries of self-promotion. And others, through feedback and responses to the post, can offer their own guidelines and help build more community knowledge around best practice.

I'm concerned that a lot of these guidelines aren't clear. A lot of things Gleb does are completely standard practice in sales and marketing, and in the nonprofit world at large. And some of these are also done by people in the EA community and other communities penumbral to EA (in different ways) fairly regularly. This makes it hard for an outside observer to understand where exactly the line is being drawn. Uncharitable outsiders may conclude hypocrisy or lack of self-awareness in the movement.

Examples:

- People have regularly exaggerated claims of exponential and rapid growth of the EA movement and community. This includes people affiliated with organizations that plausibly benefit financially from exaggerated beliefs about EA's growth rate. My general interpretation of their position is that they believe in things, and are selecting the evidence that most fits their beliefs and the story they are passionate about (and may even be unaware of contradictory narratives). Few of them have been called out on it, the way Gleb is called out for alleged exaggeration of social media numbers (exaggeration that is often a result of factors outside Gleb's control -- such as bots responding to payment to Facebook for content promotion, not at his behest, or Facebook reporting likes + comments + shares as shares, something that is not very intuitive and a major source of confusion for people, as Linchuan and Jacy have noted).

- People within the EA community and outside it often fail to provide adequate complete disclosure. See e.g. http://effective-altruism.com/ea/10l/june_2016_givewell_board_meeting/83t (where Claire did not disclose that she works at GiveWell, even though the comment was, prima facie, specifically about GiveWell's position in the EA community) and e.g. Ben Hoffman, who initially did not disclose his former affiliation with GiveWell in a post that heavily discussed GiveWell (he did add the disclosure after I pointed it out to him, see e.g. https://www.facebook.com/benjamin.r.hoffman/posts/578491328305?comment_id=578505564775&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R3%22%7D).

- In general, people within the EA community, the rationality community, and elsewhere, often fail to disclose relevant real-world associations. Most of Bryan Caplan's blog posts where he talks of Tyler Cowen don't mention that Tyler Cowen helped him get his current job. They may not even mention that they are professors together in the same university. Even when he does disclose relationships, they aren't complete. For instance, in https://www.amazon.com/review/REIMU12F4KAMU/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804785961&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=133140011&store=digital-text#wasThisHelpful Caplan discloses that Jones was a co-blogger and debate partner but not that they are funded by the same employer.

As another (more directly relevant) example, Jeff, in his critique of Intentional Insights, fails to clearly disclose that he and his wife have funded (to a significant extent!) organizations with an outreach mission sufficiently competitive with InIn that he could be construed as having a direct vested interest in the matter (also, his wife sits on the board of directors of GiveWell).

None of these associations are hidden per se, but the fact that they aren't disclosed clearly means that outsiders (or even insiders) who chance upon these threads may fail to correct for the biases that could creep in from these associations.

- Not-very-insightful comments by elites are admired, while similar comments by unknown people are seen as vote-stuffing. For instance, Carl's simple, straightforward comment "Thanks for the useful public service Issa! Also, Vipul for sponsoring it." at http://effective-altruism.com/ea/10l/june_2016_givewell_board_meeting/83h got 9 upvotes! Whereas similar comments on posts by Gleb's folks are treated as evincing poor understanding of the material.

- I've already mentioned this earlier, but Gleb's aggressive promotional posting of content is comparable with the level of people like Robert (promoting 80,000 Hours material) or Tyler (mass-posting about EA Global).
