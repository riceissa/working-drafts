Fixes to http://market.subwiki.org/wiki/Price_ceiling

Since a price ceiling creates a shortfall, it is not immediately clear which of the buyers willing to buy the good at the lower price will succeed in buying it (i.e., there is [[non-price competition]] among buyers, as discussed later in this page). Under the '''efficient allocation assumption''' (i.e., if the good is acquired by the buyers who value it most highly, and this non-price competition comes at no extra cost to buyers and sellers), the deadweight loss equals that arising from the case when the same quantity traded is accomplished by means of a [[sales tax]]. For more discussion, see [[Effect of price ceiling on social surplus]].

For some of the rows, we can draw definite conclusions only under the '''efficient allocation assumption''': the buyers who acquire the good are those who value it most highly, ''and'' the non-price competition imposes no extra costs on buyers and sellers.

| Less than the optimal price and greater than the free market marginal cost || More (assuming efficient allocation), indeterminate otherwise || Less || More (assuming efficient allocation), indeterminate otherwise

| Equal to the free market marginal cost || Same (assuming efficient allocation), less otherwise || Less || More (assuming efficient allocation), indeterminate otherwise || Decreasing || Decreasing || Ambiguous || The quantity traded mimics that in the no-ceiling case, but the price at which the trades occur is lower. Assuming efficient allocation (i.e., the goods go to the buyers valuing them most highly), the social surplus is the same but it is distributed more to consumers. Without the efficient allocation assumption, total social surplus is down, with producer surplus down and the effect on consumer surplus indeterminate.
