This page is a '''timeline of [[senescence]] research''', including major theories, breakthroughs and organizations. "Senescence" here refers to "Ageing" rather than the phenomena of [[cellular senescence]], which is a change in cell state associated with ageing, cancer prevention, wound healing, regeneration and embryonic/placenta development.

|Ancient Greece || Early speculations on aging are focussed on the bodily [[Humorism|humoral]] imbalance and on the gradual loss of inner heat.<ref name=history-of-research/>

| Middle Age/Renaissance|| Rejuvenating or stopping the aging process is a major concern in this period.<ref name=history-of-research>{{cite journal |author=Andrea Grignolio, Claudio Franceschi |title=History of Research into Ageing/Senescence |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470015902.a0023955/abstract |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0023955}}</ref>
|-
|Renaissance–18th century || Some themes around which aging and senescence research revolves around are the idea that senescence is itself an illness, the image of the aged body as a lamp in which life-fuel has run out, the character alterations of elders, and the attempt to prolong life through specific diet or by substituting damaged body parts.<ref name=history-of-research/>

|Late 19th–20th century || Starting from the so-called "[[fin-de-siècle]]"  period, scientific optimism flourishes, and life-extensionism represents the most radical form of the trend.<ref name=ilia-stambler>{{cite book |last= |first= |date=2014 |title=A History of Life-Extensionism In The Twentieth Century |url= |location=Rison Lezion, Israel |publisher=Longevity History |page= |isbn=1500818577}}</ref> Life expectancy starts to rise in the Western world.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy/ |title=Life Expectancy}}</ref>

| c. 99 BC – c. 55 BC|| Theory || Roman poet and philosopher [[Lucretius]] argues that aging and death are beneficial because they make room for the next generation.

|-
| 1891 || Theory || [[August Weismann]] proposes the first formal programmed aging theory as an evolutionary explanation of aging driven by group selection. His argument is that aging evolved to the advantage of the species (e.g., by replacing worn out individuals with younger ones), not the individual.<ref>{{cite webpage|url=http://www.programmed-aging.org/programmed_aging_theory_FAQ.html|title=Biological Aging Theory - Frequently asked Questions and Answers}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A Weismann| URL=http://www.senescence.info/evolution_of_aging.html}}</ref> ||

|1908|| Theory || [[Max Rubner]] describes his ''[[rate-of-living theory]]'', which proposes that a slow metabolism increases an animal's longevity.

|-
|1950s || Theory ||  [[Denham Harman]] presents his ''[[free radical theory of aging]]'', which states that organisms age over time due to the accumulation of damage from free radicals in the body.<ref name=oxidative-stress/>||

|-
| 1957 || Theory|| [[George C. Williams]] proposes the today called ''[[Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis]]'' (AP) for the evolution of aging.  It occurs when one gene controls for more than one phenotypic trait where at least one of these is beneficial to the organism's fitness and at least one is detrimental, thus accumulating damage.<ref name=the-evolution-of-aging/><ref name="williams">{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2406060 |author=Williams, G.C.|title=Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence|journal=Evolution|volume=11|issue=4|pages=398–411 |year=1957|format=PDF|url=http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf|jstor=2406060}} Paper in which Williams describes his theory of antagonistic pleiotropy.</ref> ||
|-
|1958 || Theory || [[Gioacchino Failla|G. Failla]] and [[Leó Szilárd]] propose the ''[[Somatic mutation theory]]'', which suggests that aging is caused by random DNA damage in somatic cells and that the extent of damage is enhanced by radiation.<ref name=ilia-stambler/> ||
