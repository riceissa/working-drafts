== History ==

On November 12, 1999, the [[106th United States Congress]] passed the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act (P.L. 106-95), which called for the creation of a new H-1C visa for nurses going to work for up to three years in health professional shortage areas. Up to 500 nurses per year can get the visa, but each state is limited to 25 H-1C nurses a year.<ref name=pl-106-95/><ref name=ilw>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilw.com/articles/2007,1217-siskind.shtm|title=ILW.COM - immigration news: Immigrant's Weekly: H-1C Visas for Registered Nurses|publisher = [[Immigration Daily]]|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref><ref name=federal-register-1999-law>{{cite web|url = https://www.federalregister.gov/regulations/1615-AA35/petitioning-requirements-for-the-h-1c-nonimmigrant-classification-under-public-law-106-95|title = Petitioning Requirements for the H-1C Nonimmigrant Classification Under Public Law 106-95|publisher = ''[[Federal Register]]''|accessdate = July 2, 2016}}</ref>  The 1999 law is very similar to a 1989 law that created the [[H-1A visa]] for nurses.<ref name=uscis-nra>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary/nursing-relief-act-1989|title = Nursing Relief Act of 1989|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|accessdate = July 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name=hr-1507>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/1507|title=H.R.1507 - Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989|last=|first=|date=September 13, 1989|publisher = [[United States Congress]]|access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref> That visa category had expired in 1995 after unsuccessful efforts to extend its life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visalaw.com/h-1a-nurse-visa-program-appears-likely-to-expire/|title=H-1A NURSE VISA PROGRAM APPEARS LIKELY TO EXPIRE - Siskind Susser PC|date=1995-09-30|website=Siskind Susser PC|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}</ref> 

The key differences between the two programs are:<ref name=ilw/>

* The number of H-1C visas is capped at 500 per year, significantly less than the annual number of H-1A visas issued when the H-1A was first introduced.
* The facility where the nurse will work must be in a [[health professional]] shortage area.

One of the few immigration measures passed by the [[109th United States Congress]] was the extension of the H-1C category. In November 2006, Congress approved legislation to extend the H-1C program for three more years.<ref name=ilw/> This classification expired as of December 20, 2009.<ref name=federal-register-1999-law/><ref name=uscis-h-1c-guide/> The last H-1C visas were issued in Fiscal Year 2012.<ref name=visa-data/>
