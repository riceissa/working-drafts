|-
|Prehistory||The knowledge of the medicinal value of plants and other substances and their uses goes back to the time of the earliest settlers. Medical knowledge evolves through trial and error and exchange of know-how between diverse communities and regions.<ref name=Overview-of-Indian-healing-traditions/>
|-
|Traditional medicine period||[[Ayurveda]], the science of life, has been the traditional system of healthcare in India for more than 5000 years. This medical system is well established around 2500 to 600 BC, when it evolves into 2 schools: the School of Physicians and the School of Surgeons.<ref name=ayurveda-a-historical-perspective>{{cite journal |author=Mishra L, Singh BB, Dagenais S. |date= |title=Ayurveda, a historical perspective and principles of the traditional healthcare system in India. |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11253415 |journal= |publisher=PubMed |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |pmc= |pmid=11253415 }}</ref> 
|-
|1600-1947|| [[British Empire|British colonial]] period. [[East India Company]] is established. Many British physicians assume broader scholarly roles and European medicine comes to be looked upon as the dominant medical knowledge system. British official colonial policy marginalizes indigenous medicine to secondary status. Notwithstanding European medicine becomes the official [[Health system|health care system]], Ayurvedic colleges are still created. Ayurveda education becomes integrated with western concepts of healthcare.<ref name=Overview-of-Indian-healing-traditions/>
|-
|1947-onward||Post-independence period. The government of India makes efforts to recognize Ayurveda, [[Siddha]] and [[Unani]] as being on par with [[medicine|scientific medicine]]. Nevertheless, the general trend increasingly complies with the norms of modern medicine. In traditional medical schools the vocabulary and diagnostic tools of modern medicine replace traditional terms and techniques, and students increasingly become unfamiliar with classical references and methodologies.<ref name=Overview-of-Indian-healing-traditions/>
|-
|1980-onward|| Numerous government subsidies allow the introduction of private health providers. Also opening up of the market in the 90s further gives impetus to the development of the private health sector in India.<ref>Baru,Rama V(2010): “Public Sector Doctors in an Era of Commercialisation” in Sheikh and A George(ed)Health Providers in India, on the Frontlines of Change(New Delhi: Routledge)81-96.</ref> Immunization programs increase. 
|-
|21th century||Today, the health status of India is still on a [[developing country|developing]] level. The [[private sector]] is the dominant healthcare provider. Private chains of healthcare providers are innovating very rapidly, offering high quality treatment at very low cost. As India incorporates world class technology and training, and low cost of service, a trend of [[medical tourism]] is developing in and strengthens toward the last years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Amit Sengupta |date= |title=The private health sector in India |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1285083/ |journal= |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7526.1157 |pmc=1285083 |pmid= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/05/17/840571/0/en/Favorable-exchange-rate-boost-the-medical-tourism-industry-MRRSE.html||title=Favorable exchange rate boost the medical tourism industry: MRRSE}}</ref>
