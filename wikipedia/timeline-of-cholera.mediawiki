'''[[Cholera]]''' is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It infects the small intestine. Cholera is still active throughout the world. Estimates from 2010 say that between three- and five million people get cholera every year, and 58,000–130,000 people die from the disease every year.<ref name=Loz2012>{{cite journal | author = Lozano R, Naghavi M, ''et al.'' 2012 | title = Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 | journal = Lancet | volume = 380 | issue = 9859 | pages = 2095–128 | pmid = 23245604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0}}</ref>
