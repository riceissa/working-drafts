== What to source ==

* For events before launch of AWS blog, main AWS announcements. After AWS blog came out, use AWS blog.

* Coverage in mainstream media (e.g. NYT) if applicable. For launch in non-US regions look for local media coverage.

* Coverage in tech media (TechCrunch, Mashable)

* Tech websites that provide detailed review or discussion of AWS features.
== Improved event types ==

Subtype product into storage, compute, and database and indicate subtype parenthetically.

== Rows to add ==

Services: Only include first launch of service, not first launch in each region:

* Route 53

* CloudFormation

* EC2 Container Service

* Lambda

* Beanstalk (?)

Major pricing cuts in EC2, S3, that received wide coverage

Misc:

* First reInvent conference

* Security and privacy landmarks e.g. those mentioned in https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_EU_Data_Protection_Whitepaper.pdf

* Large scale customer migrations: Snowball, Snowmobile, etc.

* Government agency use of AWS: We already have GovCloud launch, but is there more?
