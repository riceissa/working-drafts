==Initiatives and partnerships==
The SVEF has developed various resources available to school districts around Silicon Valley.

===Elevate [Math] and [Science] ===
This program is 75 hour, 19 day long summer intervention program that focuses on preparing 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th graders for more advanced math and science courses, as well as offering teachers a 35 hour course for the development of their skills, which is based on [[Common Core]] ideals.<ref name=elevatedmath>{{cite web|url=http://svefoundation.org/programs/elevate/|title = Elevate [Math]|publisher = Silicon Valley Education Foundation|accessdate = 2016-06-03}}</ref><ref name=elevatedmath1>{{cite web|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-mention/silicon-valley-education-foundation-arms-middle-sc/|title =Silicon Valley Education Foundation arms middle-schoolers for college track classes|publisher = Knight Foundation|accessdate = 2016-06-04}}</ref>

===iHub===
This pilot program is a platform for entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley to propose various educational products and technological solutions in order to improve education. Feedback from both students and teachers allows for entrepreneurs to further enhance their products, potentially for later introduction into the market. Collaborators and partners of this program include the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]], and several others.<ref name=ihub>{{cite web|url=http://svefoundation.org/ihub/|title = iHub|publisher = Silicon Valley Education Foundation|accessdate = 2016-06-04}}</ref><ref name=gates-2013/> It is distinct from the [[iHub]] located in Kenya.

The SVEF also hosts the Learning Innovation Hub (iHub) Pitch Games, in which entrepreneurs present a product or business model, and judges proceed to ask them questions with which the judges get a better feel for the product or business model, and decide winners. Funding for the competition comes from grants made by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.<ref name=ihub1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/10/08/six-edtech-startups-named-winners-at-the-third.html|title =Six EdTech startups named winners at the third 'Learning Innovation Hub (iHub) Pitch Games'|publisher = ''[[Silicon Valley Business Journal]]''|accessdate = 2016-06-04}}</ref><ref name=ihub2>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_27335833/q-muhammed-chaudhry-ceo-silicon-valley-education-foundation|title =Q&A: Muhammed Chaudhry, CEO of Silicon Valley Education Foundation|publisher = ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''|accessdate = 2016-06-04}}</ref>
===49ers STEM Leadership Institute===
This program was established in a partnership between the [[San Francisco 49ers]], the SVEF, and the [[Santa Clara Unified School District]]. It is a 6 year long program for grades 7-12, which offers a college-preparatory curriculum that is focused on STEM.<ref name=sli>{{cite web|url=http://svefoundation.org/sli/|title = 49ers STEM Leadership Institute|publisher = Silicon Valley Education Foundation|accessdate = 2016-06-03}}</ref><ref name=sli1>{{cite web|url=https://cabrillo-scusd-ca.schoolloop.com/49ersSTEM|title = 49ers STEM Leadership Institute|publisher = Cabrillo Middle School|accessdate = 2016-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.levisstadium.com/2014/07/49ers-foundation-launch-stem-leadership-institute/|title = 49ers Foundation to Launch STEM Leadership Institute|publisher = Levi's Stadium|date = July 14, 2014|accessdate = June 4, 2016}}</ref>

===Teacher Innovation Grants===
Sponsors such as [[Wells Fargo]] allow the SVEF to make annual grants called Teacher Innovation Grants (TIG)<ref name=grants>{{cite web|url=http://svefoundation.org/programs/teacher-innovation-grants/|title = Wells Fargo Teacher Innovation Grants|publisher = Silicon Valley Education Foundation|accessdate = 2016-06-03}}</ref> to teachers in Silicon Valley who apply for this grant. Individual teachers are allowed to apply for up to $1000 for class projects or field-trips, whereas 2 or more teachers are allowed to apply for up to $1500. SVEF has made nearly $800,000 worth of grants for around 1,400 teachers.<ref name=grants></ref>
===East Side Alliance===
The [[East Side Alliance]], ESA is a partnership between 8 school districts in the state of California and Silicon Valley, which serves around 85,000 students. Partners and districts in the ESA agree to collaborate towards common goals, in order to benefit students. [[San Jose State University]] is also a member of this partnership, and students of member districts are hence given an opportunity for admission to the university by better fitting their standards.<ref name=esa>{{cite web|url=http://svefoundation.org/esa/|title = East Side Alliance|publisher = Silicon Valley Education Foundation|accessdate = 2016-06-04}}</ref><ref name=esa1>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.sjsu.edu/wsq/2015/12/01/innovating-silicon-valley-classrooms/|title = Innovating Silicon Valley Classrooms|publisher = Washington Square: The Stories of San Jose State University|accessdate = 2016-06-04}}</ref>
