This is a '''timeline of [[influenza]]''', briefly describing major events such as [[outbreaks]], [[epidemics]], [[pandemics]], discoveries and developments of [[vaccines]]. In addition to specific year/period-related events, there's the [[flu season|seasonal flu]] that kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people every year, and has claimed between 340 million and 1 billion human lives throughout history. <ref name="WHO Europe Influenza">{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/influenza |title=WHO Europe – Influenza |date = June 2009|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=12 June 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090617212626/http://www.euro.who.int/influenza| archivedate= 17 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="WHO Influenza">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs211/en/ |title=Influenza: Fact sheet |date = March 2003|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |accessdate=7 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090505070146/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs211/en/| archivedate= 5 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

|Prior to 20th century||Little is known about influenza during most of history. Although the virus seems to have caused epidemics throughout human history, historical data on influenza are difficult to interpret, because the symptoms can be similar to those of other respiratory diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal| pmid = 1724803| volume = 13| issue = 2| pages = 223–234| last = Beveridge| first = W I| title = The chronicle of influenza epidemics| journal = History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences| year = 1991}}</ref><ref name=Potter/>
|-
|20th Century||Century of flu pandemics, starting with the deadly [[Spanish flu]], it's also the period of virus isolation and development of vaccines. 
|-
|1945-21th century||International health organizations merge, and large scale vaccination campaigns begin.<ref>{{cite book|title=Vaccine Analysis: Strategies, Principles, and Control|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783662450246|page=61|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=vJKeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA61}}</ref>
|-
|21th century||Worldwide accessible databases multiply in order to control outbreaks and prevent pandemics. New influenza strain outbreaks still occur. Efficacy of currently available vaccines is still insufficient to diminish the current annual health burden induced by the virus.<ref>{{cite book|title=Vaccine Analysis: Strategies, Principles, and Control|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783662450246|page=61|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=vJKeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA61}}</ref>
