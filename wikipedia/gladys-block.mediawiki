=== Block FFQ ===

During her time at the [[National Cancer Institute]] (1982 to 1991), Block developed a semi-quantitative [[food frequency questionnaire]] (FFQ) that would later come to be known as the Block FFQ.<ref name=D>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdenver.edu/research/CCTSI/programs-services/ctrc/Nutrition/Documents/Food_Frequency_Questionnaires.pdf|title = Food Frequency Questionnaires|accessdate = September 20, 2016|publisher = [[University of Colorado Denver]]}}</ref> The approach to questionnaire design was first described in a paper co-authored with Hartman, Dresser, Carroll, Gannon, and Gardner in 1986.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/124/3/453.long|title = A data-based approach to diet questionnaire design and testing|last = Block|first = Gladys|last2 = Hartman|first2 = AM|last3 = Dresser|first3 = CM|last4 = Carroll|first4 = MD|last5 = Gannon|first5 = J|last6 = Gardner|first6 = L|journal = [[American Journal of Epidemiology]]|year = 1986|volume = 124|pages = 453-469|pmid = 3740045}}</ref> Research by Block, Potosky, and Clifford on validation of the questionnaire was published in 1990.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089543569090099B|title = Validation of a self-administered diet history questionnaire using multiple diet records|last = Block|first = Gladys|last2 = Wood|first2 = M|last3 = Potosky|first3 = A|last4 = Clifford|first4 = C|journal = [[Journal of Clinical Epidemiology]]|year = 1990|volume = 43|pages = 1327-1335|pmid = 2254769|doi = 10.1016/0895-4356(90)90099-B}}</ref>

After leaving the National Cancer Institute in 1991, Block continued to work on the FFQ, offering it through the company, NutritionQuest, that she founded in 1994. Subsequent released versions include the Block 95 and Block 98 FFQs. A web version was also released and validated.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://nutritionquest.com/company/our-research-questionnaires/|title = Our Research: Questionnaires|publisher = NutritionQuest|accessdate = October 26, 2016}}</ref>

The Block FFQ has been used in third-party research<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://jn.nutrition.org/content/123/3/489.extract|title = A diet history questionnaire ranks nutrient intakes in middle-aged and older men and women similarly to multiple food records|journal = [[Journal of Nutrition]]|year = 1993|volume = 123|pages = 489-501|last = Mares-Perlman|first = JA|last2 = Klein|first2 = BEK|last3 = Klein|first3 = R|last4 = Ritter|first4 = LL|last5 = Fisher|first5 = MR|last6 = Freudenheim|first6 = JL|pmid = 8463852}}</ref> and has also been the subject of validation and comparison studies.<ref name=dhq-1-research>{{cite journal|url = http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/154/12/1089.full|title =Comparative Validation of the Block, Willett, and National Cancer Institute Food Frequency Questionnaires: The Eating at America's Table Study|last = Subar|first = Amy|last2 = Thompson|first2 = Frances|last3 = Kipnis|first3 = Victor|last4 = Midthune|first4 = Douglas|last5 = Hurwitz|first5 = Paul|last6 = McNutt|first6 = Suzanne|last7 = McIntosh|first7 = Anna|last8 = Rosenfeld|first8 = Simon|journal = [[American Journal of Epidemiology]]|year = 2001|volume = 154|pages = 1089-1099}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = Validity and reliability of the Block98 food-frequency questionnaire in a sample of Canadian women.|last = Boucher|first = B|last2 = Cotterchio|first2 = M|last3 = Krieger|first3 = N|last4 = Nadalin|first4 = V|last5 = Block|first5 = Torin|last6 = Block|first6 = Gladys|journal = [[Public Health Nutrition]]|year = 2006|volume = 9|issue = 1|pages = 84-93}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = Structured measurement error in nutritional epidemiology; applications in the Pregnancy, Infection and Nutrition (PIN) Study|last = Johnson|first = BA|last2 = Herring|first2 = AH|last3 = Ibrahim|first3 = JG|last4 = Siega-Riz|first4 = Am|journal = [[Journal of the American Statistical Association]]|year = 2007|volume = 102|issue = 479|pages = 856-866}}</ref>

The Block FFQ is the earliest of the currently widely used FFQs in the United States. Other semi-quantitative FFQs include the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ) and NHANES (also developed at the National Cancer Institute) and the Harvard FFQ, developed by a team at [[Harvard University]] led by [[Walter Willett]].<ref name=D/><ref name=ffq-filter>{{Cite web|url = http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/diet/shortreg/register.php?format%5B%5D=ffq&numitems=any&size=any&age=any&gender=any&loc=|title = Register of validated short dietary instruments (restricted to FFQs)|publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]]}}</ref>

=== The link between diet, Vitamin C (and other nutrients) and health status (particularly cancer risk) ===

While at the NCI, Block led research on the nutritional effects of the consumption of [[Vitamin C]] on health status and in particular cancer risk.<ref name=linkedin/> In a three-day symposium at the National Institutes of Health (September 10 to 12, 1990), Block summarized existing research on the role of Vitamin C in cancer prevention as follows: "Of 46 reports on epidemiologic studies, 33 described significant protective effects on cancer mortality or incidence."<ref name=nci-vitamin-c>{{cite web|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/opinion/l-studies-confirm-pauling-on-vitamin-c-s-anti-cancer-benefit-080756.html|title = Studies Confirm Pauling on Vitamin C's Anti-Cancer Benefit|last = Lawson|first = Stephen|date = August 28, 1994|accessdate = October 24, 2016|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://americannutritionassociation.org/newsletter/vitamin-c-recognized-national-cancer-institute|title = Vitamin C recognized by the National Cancer Institute|publisher = NutritionDigest|accessdate = October 24, 2016}}</ref> In 1992, Block's review of 15 epidemiological studies on cancer rates and intake of Vitamin C was cited in the ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref name=nyt-vitamin-win>{{cite web|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/10/science/vitamins-win-support-as-potent-agents-of-health.html?pagewanted=all|title = Vitamins Win Support as Potent Agents of Health|date = March 10, 1992|accessdate = October 25, 2016|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref>

Block continued to study the effect of vitamin and other nutrient consumption on health status while at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Her research results have generally supported the idea that vitamin consumption reduces the risk of adverse health conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and hypertension, and that dietary supplements can be an effective source of vitamins (albeit not as good as direct consumption of fruits and vegetables containing the relevant nutrients).<ref>{{cite journal|url = https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-6-30|title = Usage patterns, health, and nutritional status of long-term multiple dietary supplement users: a cross-sectional study|journal = [[Nutrition Journal]]|date = October 24, 2007|accessdate = October 24, 2016|last = Block|first = Gladys|last2 = Jensen|first2 = Christopher|last3 = Norkus|first3 = Edward|last4 = Dalvi|first4 = Tapashi|last5 = Wong|first5 = Les|last6 = McManus|first6 = Jamie|last7 = Hudes|first7 = Mark|doi = 10.1186/1475-2891-6-30}}</ref> 

Block's findings on the relation between Vitamin C, diet patterns (including consumption of fruits and vegetables as well as dietary supplements), and cancer have been cited in popular press pieces including in the ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/05/science/scientist-at-work-bruce-n-ames-strong-views-on-origins-of-cancer.html?pagewanted=all|title = SCIENTIST AT WORK: Bruce N. Ames; Strong Views on Origins of Cancer|last = Brody|first = Jane E.|date = July 5, 1994|accessdate = October 25, 2016|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref> 

Block has been cited in media coverage of the debate around the efficacy of dietary multivitamin supplements in combating health risks including the risk of cancer, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Others taking a similar position as Block (in favor of dietary supplements) include Harvard professor [[Walter Willett]] (designer of the Harvard FFQ), researcher [[Bruce N. Ames]], and Michael Jacobson of the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]]. Those on the other side include Marion Nestle, Joan Gussow, Catherine Wotecki, Walter Mertz, and Edgar Miller.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/14/garden/eating-well.html|title = Eating Well|last = Burros|first = Marian|date = April 14, 1993|accessdate = October 25, 2016|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/20/garden/eating-well.html|title = Eating Well|date = April 20, 1994|accessdate = October 25, 2016|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/16/health/multivitamins-studies/|title = Are multivitamins a waste of money?
