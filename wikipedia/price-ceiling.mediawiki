==Definition==

A '''price ceiling''' is an upper limit placed by the government or a regulatory authority with government sanction on the price (per unit) of a commodity.

A price ceiling is a form of [[price control]]. The other form of price control is a [[minimum price]].

There are two types of price ceilings:

* '''Non-binding price ceiling''': This is a [[price ceiling]] that is greater than the current [[market price]].
* '''Binding price ceiling''': This is a [[price ceiling]] that is less than the current [[market price]].

A particularly extreme form of price ceiling, which is not usually thought of that way, is a price ceiling of zero. This refers to situations where it is legal to give a good or service for free but it is illegal to offer the good or service in exchange for money. Price ceilings of zero are usually justified on aesthetic and ethical grounds as it is believed that the exchange of money sullies certain types of transaction. Since the market price for most forms of exchange is positive, price ceilings of zero are typically binding price ceilings. Examples include:

* [[Prostitution]] (the sale of sexual services), which is illegal, though not often rigorously prosecuted, in many countries
* [[Organ trade]], i.e., there are often jurisdictions where it is legal to donate an organ such as a kidney but illegal to buy or sell it.
* Adoption: In many places, it is not legal for a pregnant mother to sell her baby for adoption to a couple willing to adopt the kid, though it is legal to put the baby up for adoption.

==Basic theory: the effects of price ceilings in competitive markets==

===Non-binding price ceiling: price ceilings have no effect when they are above the market-clearing price===

A price ceiling that is set above the [[market price]] of the commodity has no direct effect. Such price ceilings may be put in place to prevent [[price gouging]] in the event of an emergency (not currently happening) or to prevent rapid fluctuations in prices due to other unforeseen circumstances. A price ceiling that is above the market price is termed a ''non-binding price ceiling''.

===Binding price ceiling: price ceilings create excess demand when they are below the market-clearing price===

If the price ceiling is below the [[market price]], the quantity demand for the good exceeds the quantity supplied for the good, resulting in a situation of scarcity or [[excess demand]]. This results in a loss of economic surplus compared to the situation of a market-clearing price.

For instance, in the figure below, if the price ceiling is set at the price level of the horizontal line AB, then there is a shortfall equal to the length of the segment AB.

Since a price ceiling creates a shortfall, it is not immediately clear which of the buyers willing to buy the good at the lower price will succeed in buying it (i.e., there is [[non-price competition]] among buyers, as discussed later in this page). Under the '''efficient allocation assumption''' (i.e., perfect sorting among buyers, ''and'' no costs imposed by non-price competition), the deadweight loss equals that arising from the case when the same quantity traded is accomplished by means of a [[sales tax]], and is described by the area of the [[Harberger triangle]], bounded by a vertical line through A and the demand and supply curves (so that two of its vertices are A and C). For more discussion, see [[Effect of price ceiling on economic surplus]].

==Basic theory: the effects of price ceilings in monopolistic markets==

{{NeedsGraph}}

=== The basic case of increasing marginal costs ===

We restrict attention to cases where the monopolist's marginal cost curve is increasing, to avoid issues related to multiple optima. Many of the conclusions we draw are not dependent on this assumption.

There are three key price points relative to which price ceilings can be compared. For more context, see [[determination of price and quantity supplied by monopolistic firm in the short run]].

* The '''free market price''' (without any price ceiling), chosen by the monopolist for profit maximization.
* The '''optimal price''', which is the price point for the intersection of the market demand curve and the monopolist's short-run marginal cost curve. We can also think of this as what the market price would be if the market were competitive. This is based on the [[determination of quantity supplied by firm in perfectly competitive market in the short run]], where we find that the supply curve coincides with the short-run marginal cost curve if the latter is increasing.
* The '''free market marginal cost''', which is the marginal cost at the quantity being traded without any price ceiling. This is equal to the marginal revenue, since a monopolist optimizes at marginal cost equals marginal revenue.

There are two interesting values of quantity traded:

* The '''market quantity traded''', which is the quantity traded in the market without any price ceiling.
* The '''optimal quantity traded''', which is the maximum possible quantity traded, and is the quantity at the intersection of the market demand curve and the monopolist's short-run marginal cost curve. We can also think of this as what the market quantity traded would be if a competitive market were simulated with the same demand and supply structure.

We can now make cases based on the value of the price ceiling. We move the price ceiling ''down'', so the earlier rows discuss larger price ceilings and the later rows discuss lower price ceilings.

For any given price ceiling, there are two possibilities:

* It is a non-binding price ceiling, i.e., it is greater than or equal to the free market price. In this case, the market behavior remains the same as it would in a free market.
* It is a binding price ceiling, i.e., it is less than the free market price. In this case, the market price equals the binding price (note that this is no longer true with more complicated market structures, such as the case when the marginal cost curve is not increasing).

=== More general cases ===

Without the assumption of increasing marginal costs, we can have a situation of re-optimization to a new optimal price. In other words, rather than the price gradually going down, it could jump down significantly due to a re-optimization.


==Short-run impact of binding price ceilings in perfectly competitive markets==

===Non-price competition among buyers===

The key problem that needs to be solved in case of a binding price ceiling is the problem: given that the quantity supplied is less than the quantity demanded, who among the different potential buyers of the good gets how much of it? Note that this problem does not arise in case there is a single buyer.

One solution to this problem is [[non-price competition]] among potential buyers. An example of non-price competition is [[queueing]] -- the buyers stand in line to buy the good, and those who are too far behind in line end up not getting any of the good. There are other mechanisms of non-price competition.

The chief drawback of non-price competition is that it results in a [[deadweight loss]] because the buyers spend effort competing with each other but there are no net gains to society from this effort.

===Black market===

A [[black market]], or an illegal market in the good, is one way around the problem of a price ceiling. In this scenario, a small quantity of the good is sold in the legal market at a price equal to the price ceiling, whereas the rest of the commodity is sold in the black market at the true equilibrium price. In fact, the black market price may well be ''higher'' than the market price would be in the absence of a price ceiling, because of the added costs incurred by sellers to evade the law.

===Effect on economic surplus===

{{further|[[effect of price ceiling on economic surplus]]}}

Under most sets of assumptions, price ceilings have a negative effect on economic surplus. There are, however, some theoretical exceptions, whose incidence in practice is debated. In general, the following are true:

* Non-binding price ceilings have no effect on economic surplus.
* Binding price ceilings have negative effects on economic surplus as well as producer surplus, with the magnitude of the effect increasing as the ceiling price goes lower. The effect on consumer surplus is ambiguous.

==Short-run impact of binding price ceilings in monopolistic markets==

===Reduction of monopoly profits===

A monopolist enjoys an economic profit that firms in perfect competition do not receive, because they are able to set the price and quantity sold in the whole market to maximize their profits. This excess profit is reduced when a price control is imposed, as it constrains the monopolist and requires them to offer the good at a price and quantity which does not maximize their profits (or else they would have chosen that price and quantity in the first place).

===Effect on economic surplus===

{{further|[[effect of price ceiling on economic surplus]]}}

Here we assume that the good being sold has no [[external cost|external costs]] or [[external benefit|external benefits]].

The discussion builds on the section [[Price_ceiling#Binding_price_ceilings_above_marginal_cost_at_the_pre-ceiling_level_of_production]].

For some of the rows, we can draw definite conclusions only under the '''efficient allocation assumption''': perfect sorting among buyers (the buyers who acquire the good are those who value it most highly), ''and'' the non-price competition imposes no extra costs on buyers and sellers. The caveats are noted in the corresponding cells where they apply.

==Long-run impact of price ceiling==

===Innovation and substitution between product lines===

Price ceilings, both binding and non-binding, can have important long-run effects, including:

* Sellers may choose to rebrand or redefine their products so as to make cheaper or lower quality products that fit in the same category as the original product, or to shift the costs on to auxiliary products. For instance, if a price ceiling is imposed on the sale of cellphones, but what a "cellphone" is is not clearly specified, sellers may shift to stocking more of the cheaper and low cost cellphones. Alternatively, sellers may choose to shift costs from the cellphone to the payment plans so they end up selling the cellphones cheap but raise the price of the payment plans.
* Conversely, sellers may be reluctant to create new products in the category for fear that they will not be able to charge a higher price for the new product to recoup the cost of creation. This concern applies even in the case of non-binding price ceilings. Goods with high upfront investment costs command a high price at the beginning, and sellers then engage in [[price skimming]] as competitors catch up, and eventually the new products become as cheap as the older products used to be, and perhaps even cheaper. ''It is thus possible that the existence of a price ceiling scares away innovation that would ultimately have a more beneficial long run impact in terms of reducing cost and improving quality''.

To avoid these, the following are usually done:

* Price ceilings are typically applied for commodities like oil or grain where the unit measurements are reasonably clear and the problem above of a new technology does not arise.
* Sometimes, price ceilings are applied only to certain brands and products and the same sellers are allowed to sell alternate or new products at unrestricted prices.

===Disaster planning===

Non-binding price ceilings are sometimes put in place to prevent [[price gouging]] in the event of natural disasters. This may reduce incentives for sellers to be well stocked with goods for natural disasters as they will be unable to command the full market price for the good in the event of a disaster.

===Firms in declining-cost industries may leave the market===

There are some industries where the average cost of producing a unit of the good actually declines as more units are produced. This often happens if there are fixed costs of production. The result is that the average cost of producing a unit will exceed the marginal cost of producing a unit, and generally only one firm will supply the market. This is often called a case of ''natural monopoly''. The problem is that when a price control is established that would otherwise raise the quantity sold (as described above), the new price will be below the average cost of producing a unit, and so the monopolist firm will no longer be profitable.

In order to raise total surplus in this sort of monopoly situation, a price control set at the marginal cost of production will be insufficient. The firm will either have to be allowed to engage in [[price discrimination]] so that the profit-maximizing level of production will be closer to the socially optimal level of production, will have to be subsidized by the government so that it can sell units closer to marginal cost, or will have to be allowed to sell units at or above the average cost of production. This last option has less potential to raise total surplus, as it cannot allow the socially optimal level of production to prevail. However, the other options can also present difficulties, including distributional issues with price discrimination (more of the total surplus is taken up by the monopolist) and funding issues with subsidies (funding subsidies via distortionary taxes can actually create another deadweight loss).

==Related notions==

* [[Maximum retail price]] is an upper limit that the producer or wholesale distributor puts on the price at which retailers can sell the commodity to customers. Maximum retail prices do not usually have the inefficiencies associated with price ceilings, because producers of the goods can vary maximum retail prices according to demand trends over the somewhat longer term.
