This page is a timeline of major events in the history of '''cellular agriculture'''.  Cellular agriculture refers to the development of agricultural products - especially [[Animal product|animal products]] - from [[Cell culture|cell cultures]] rather than the bodies of living organisms.  This in includes [[In vitro meat|in vitro or cultured meat]], as well as in vitro dairy, eggs, leather, gelatin, and silk.  In recent years a number of cellular animal agriculture companies and non-profits have emerged due to technological advances and increasing concern over the [[Animal welfare|animal welfare]] and [[Animal rights|rights]], [[Environmentalism|environmental]], and [[Public health|public health]] problems associated with conventional animal agriculture.<ref name="animalist">{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@TheAnimalist/cellular-agriculture-for-a-brighter-future-142058ff6d1a#.vqlb0g1gf |title=Cellular agriculture for a brighter future |date=March 22, 2016 |accessdate=June 6, 2016}}</ref>
