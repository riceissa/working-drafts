==Ways of extending post-completion OPT==
These extensions of OPT have been vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia effective May 10, 2016 (formerly February 12, 2016) but remain in place until that date.

===H-1B cap gap extension===

The H-1B cap gap is a specific provision for extending the OPT with very limited applicability. Specifically it applies for people who, at the end date of their OPT, satisfy the following condition: they have a pending or approved [[Form I-129]] petition for [[H-1B visa|H-1B status]] in the "capped" category, but the start date for the H-1B status has not yet arrived. In particular, therefore, the H-1B cap gap ''de facto'' applies ''only'' for people whose OPT end date is between April 1 and October 1 (this is because in practice almost all cap-subject H-1B applications are made in the first week of April and choose a start date around October 1).<ref name=uchicago/><ref name=uscis-cap-gap>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-and-fashion-models/extension-post-completion-optional-practical-training-opt-and-f-1-status-eligible-students-under-h-1b-cap-gap-regulations|title = Extension of Post Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) and F-1 Status for Eligible Students under the H-1B Cap-Gap Regulations|accessdate = February 9, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}</ref><ref name=dhs-cap-gap>{{cite web|url = https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/cap-gap|title = Cap Gap|publisher = [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]|accessdate = February 9, 2016}}</ref> Note also that the H-1B cap gap extension does not apply to workers who have applied for a H-1B visa from a cap-exempt employer (cap-exempt employers include research institutions that have acquired the relevant status; most universities and research centers have this status). Cap-exempt employers can apply year-round for H-1Bs.

The H-1B cap gap allows the worker to continue being employed under OPT until the worker is informed about his or her H-1B application status. If the application is approved, the worker must switch to H-1B status once the H-1B period begins (usually October 1). If the application is revoked or denied, the worker's work authorization is terminated immediately and the worker must stop working at once. The worker still has a 60-day grace period to leave the United States.

For students who avail of the H-1B cap gap, the total unemployment period is still 90 days (or 120 days if the cap-gap was applied for while the student was on the STEM extension).<ref name=uscis-cap-gap/>

If people apply for H-1Bs while on their original OPT (i.e., not extended using the H-1B cap gap extension), and are rejected from H-1B, they may continue on OPT until the end date indicated on their OPT. If their H-1B application is authorized, they may choose to switch to H-1B on the H-1B start date and have their OPT ended. They cannot simultaneously be on OPT and H-1B.<ref name=uscis-cap-gap/>

It is also possible to apply for and get a cap gap extension after one's OPT work authorization is over, during the 60-day grace period. However, in this case, one cannot continue to work. For instance, if one's OPT ends on March 15, and one applies for H-1B status on April 1 with a start date of October 1, one could apply for the cap gap extension in April and receive it, and thereby stay in the United States as a student till October 1, but without being able to either work or enroll in classes.<ref name=uscis-cap-gap/><ref name=dhs-cap-gap/>

=== STEM extension ===

The STEM extension is a 17-month or 24-month extension of the post-completion OPT that is specific to workers who graduated in eligible [[STEM fields|STEM]] fields. On March 11, 2016, changes were announced to the rules governing the STEM extension, effective May 10, 2016.<ref name=uscis-stem-opt-change>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment/stem-opt|title = Optional Practical Training Extension for STEM Students (STEM OPT)|accessdate = April 11, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}</ref><ref name=nafsa-stem-change>{{cite web|url = http://www.nafsa.org/Find_Resources/Supporting_International_Students_And_Scholars/ISS_Issues/STEM_OPT_Rulemaking/|title = STEM OPT Rulemaking|date = March 22, 2016|accessdate = April 11, 2016|publisher = NAFSA}}</ref><ref name=stem-opt-hub>{{cite web|url = https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/stem-opt-hub|title = STEM OPT|publisher = Study in the States, [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]|accessdate = April 11, 2016}}</ref> Both the old and the new rule are compared below.

|-
| Duration || Maximum duration of 17 months, over and above the 12-month OPT, so a maximum total OPT duration of 29 months. || Maximum duration of 24 months, over and above the 12-month OPT, so a maximum total OPT duration of 36 months.
|-
| Degree rule || The degree that OPT is associated be must be in a STEM field. || The student must have a degree in a STEM field (not necessarily from a United States institution), but the degree the OPT is associated with need not be a STEM degree. For instance, a student who has a Bachelors in Science (from a US or foreign university) and then a MBA from a US university can obtain the STEM extension for the OPT associated with the MBA program. The determination of whether the student's undergraduate degree was in a STEM field falls on the student's current institution (that awarded the degree for which the student is requesting OPT).
|-
| Employer rule || The current or prospective employer must be specified as part of the application, and proof of either a job or a job offer must be included. || Same rule as before.
|-
| E-verify rule || The employer must be enrolled in [[e-verify]] at the time of application. || Same rule as before.
|-
| Rule surounding repeat use || The STEM extension can be used only once in the student's lifetime (unlike ordinary OPT, which can be used once for undergraduate work and once for graduate work). || The STEM extension can be used both at the undergraduate and the graduate level but the same STEM degree cannot be used to obtain the STEM extension twice, and also the STEM extension can be applied at most once on OPT at a given level (see table below).
|-
| Earliest date of submission || The application may be submitted at most 120 days prior to the end date of the OPT. It follow a similar process as the usual OPT application, but with the forms somewhat different. || Same rule as before.
|-
| Change of jobs || The student may change jobs while on the STEM extension, but each employer must be enrolled in e-verify. As such, the same restrictions and freedoms apply as for the ordinary post-completion OPT, with the additional restriction that all employers involved must be enrolled in e-verify.
|-
| Unemployment period || The total unemployment period across the entire 29 months of OPT must be at most 120 days. || The total unemployment period across the entire 36 months of OPT must be at most 120 days.
|-
| Grace period while waiting for a response || If the student applied for the STEM extension before the OPT 12-month period expired, and was employed by the listed e-verify employer at the time of expiration, the student may continue working for that employer for up to 180 days while the application is pending. || Same as before.
|-
| Forms and procedure || Student must request a new I-20 from the Designated School Official at the institution's international office, with approval for STEM extension, the employer's e-verify number, and a requested start date. The student must then file Form I-765 with the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] to obtain an [[Employment Authorization Document]] (EAD card). || Same steps as before, but with an additional step: while requesting the new I-20, the student must also submit Form I-983 to the DSO, that the student and employer need to fill in together. [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], that runs the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, may request the Form I-983 from the DSO at any time.<ref name=students-and-form-i-983>{{cite web|url = https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students-and-the-form-i-983|title = Students and the Form I-983|accessdate = April 11, 2016|publisher = Study in the States, [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]}}</ref> <ref name=employers-and-form-i-983>{{cite web|url = https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/employers-and-the-form-i-983|title = Employers and the Form I-983|accessdate = April 11, 2016|publisher = Study in the States, [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]}}</ref>

The STEM extension can be combined with the cap gap in either direction: a student can apply for the STEM extension while on the cap gap (and choose not to transition to the H-1B status), and a student can apply for a cap gap extension while on the STEM extension.<ref name=uscis-cap-gap/>

The table below explains the rules surrounding repeat STEM use under the new and old rules:
