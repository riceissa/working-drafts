== Program details ==
This non-immigrant/temporary worker classification was introduced by the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] in 1989 to specifically address the lack of nurses in the United States.<ref name=hr-1507/><ref name=hr-3259/>

=== Eligibility ===
All H visas require an offer of employment from an U.S. employer, and proof that the wage to be paid is comparable to other positions in that occupation. In addition to these requirements, the H-2 visa necessitates a showing (by the employer) that there were no qualified U.S. workers available and willing to fill the position.<ref name=findlaw />

To qualify for an '''H-1A visa''' one must submit:<ref name=findlaw/>
* an offer of employment from an U.S. employer
* proof that the wage to be paid is comparable to other positions in that occupation
* a showing (by the employer) that there were no qualified U.S. workers available and willing to fill the position.

=== Application ===
The [[Form I-129]], Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, must be filed by a U.S. [[employer]] hospital that has received a notice of acceptance of the attestation for '''H-1A''' Nonimmigrant Nurses, from the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]].

The [[Form I-129]] must include the following documents:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visaattorneys.com/immigration-resources/H-1A-Visa-Package.Eng.pdf|title=H-1A Visas|last=Bernstein|first=Osberg-Braun|date=|website=Visaattorneys.com|publisher=Visaattorneys.com|access-date=June 12, 2016}}</ref>

* A copy of the nursing diploma/degree

== Limitations ==
Temporary visas in the H classification are subject to numerical limitations imposed by Congress. These annual limits are applied at the time of Form I-129 approval, not when somebody seeks admission to the United States.

There were several restrictions placed on this visa during its implementation and valid period.<ref name=hr-1507 />
* The employment of the alien will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of registered nurses similarly employed and the alien
* The alien must be paid at the prevailing wage for registered nurses employed by the facility
* The period of admission for an initial period shall not exceed 3 years, subject to an extension, not to exceed a total period of admission of 5 years
* Visa may be revoked by the Secretary of Labor upon finding that the facility for which the nursing certification is made no longer meets such qualifications or if there are misrepresentations in certification.
* The employer must also employ other registered nurses.

== History ==

Prior to 1989, there was a single H-1 category used for skilled workers, with no separate category for nurses. 

On March 20, 1989, [[Chuck Schumer]] sponsored the Immigration Nursing Relief Act in the [[United States House of Representatives]] as H.R.1507.<ref name=hr-1507/> It was introduced again to the House and Senate on September 13, 1989.<ref name=hr-3259/> The Act was passed on December 18, 1989 by the [[101st United States Congress]] as P.L. 101-238.<ref name=uscis-nra/><ref name=hr-3259>{{cite web|url = https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/3259|title = H.R.3259 - Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989|accessdate = July 2, 2016}}</ref> The Act had two main parts:
# It provided for the adjustment to permanent resident status of certain nonimmigrants who as of September 1, 1989, had H-1 nonimmigrant status as registered nurses; who had been employed in that capacity for at least 3 years; and whose continued nursing employment meets certain labor certification requirements.<ref name=uscis-nra/><ref name=hr-1507/>
# It created a new temporary category (H-1A) for registered nurses. It also reassigned the existing H-1 category as [[H-1B visa|H-1B]].<ref name=hr-1507/><ref name=findlaw/>

The H-1A category was permitted to sunset on September 1, 1995, with some nurses granted extensions in the category through September 30, 1997.<ref name=siskind-susser/> On November 12, 1999, the category was replaced by the newer, more restrictive, [[H-1C visa]].<ref name=pl-106-95/><ref name=visapro-nurses/> The last H-1A visas were issued in Fiscal Year 2000.<ref name=visa-data/>

The H-1C would itself expire in December 2009,<ref name=h-1c-expiration/> with the last H-1C visas issued in Fiscal Year 2012.<ref name=visa-data/>

== Statistics ==
Below are H-1A visas issued each year as released by the U.S. [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] - [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]. Years here are [[Fiscal Year]]s, so for instance the year 1993 refers to the time period from October 1, 1992 to September 30, 1993. A "N/A" indicates that data is not available; this is because country-level data became available only starting from Fiscal Year 1997.<ref name=visa-data>{{Cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/law-and-policy/statistics/non-immigrant-visas.html|title=Nonimmigrant Visa Statistics|website=travel.state.gov|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref>
