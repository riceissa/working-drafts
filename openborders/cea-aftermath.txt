In my very first post for <em>Open Borders: The Case</em>, I asked <a href="http://openborders.info/blog/why-was-immigration-freer-in-19th-century-usa">"Why was immigration freer in 19th century USA?"</a> At the time I postulated three broad categories of reasons: moral permissibility, technological feasibility, and desirability. The exploration in this post will help shed light on the relative balance of these reasons. Here's a summary:

<ul>
  <li>Moral permissibility appears to have been a non-issue in the minds of <em>most</em> people involved. But it weighed heavily on the minds of some influential people in the debate. Overall, the main difficulty with interpreting moral permissibility is that most people accepted the moral permissibility of governments having <em>some</em> authority to regulate immigration in the national interest, but there was little clear agreement on how expansively national interest was to be construed. While checks on government power were an idea that had been theoretically developed, the concept had not been developed well in practice. Insofar as permissibility issues arose, they had more to do with whether immigration policy was a federal or state matter.</li>
  <li>Desirability appears to have been the <em>primary</em> subject of most debate prior to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act.</li>
  <li>Technological feasibility probably played some background role in determining what immigration restrictions were even on the table. For instance, restrictions on immigration from Mexico or Canada did not receive any consideration until well into the 20th century, partly because of the technological infeasibility of restricting land immigration. However, it was not a primary point of debate in practice within the domain of restricting Chinese migration. Technological feasibility issues <em>did</em> become more central <em>after</em> the Act was passed, but in general the approach appears to have been to first pass a law (often one that was ambiguous both in what exactly it meant and how it would be enforced) and then "wing it" with respect to the enforcement details, passing amendments to close loopholes as needed.</li>
</ul>
