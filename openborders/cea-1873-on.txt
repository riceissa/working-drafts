<h4>The 1870s: federal restrictionism in beta</h4>

Involved parties: federal government, California state government, Chinese, "natives", local courts, Supreme Court

Immigration restrictions? Still largely untested and speculative. But no clear articulation of a basis for rejecting them.

There were a few factors where legitimate truths mixed with inaccurate inference to cast the Chinese in a bad light. Not all of these kicked in at the outset. Some took years or even decades to become widely recognized public concerns.

<ul>
	<li>One of the perverse effects of the California Gold Rush was that it attracted a disproportionate share of men relative to women. This was true of all the races and ethnicities that moved at the outset, but the gap was closed for whites over time as movement within the United States became easier. However, the gap for Chinese was great, leading to a small share of Chinese women and an <a href="<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldrush/peopleevents/p_chinese.html">even smaller share of Chinese women who were not prostitutes</a>. The solution attempted by the state of California was to deny entry to Chinese women suspected of being prostitutes, though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chy_Lung_v._Freeman">Chy Lung v. Freeman</a> overturned this. However, the federal government passed a similar restriction, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_Act_of_1875>Page Act of 1875</a>. Of course, this restriction only worsened the gender imbalance, leading to a vicious cycle.</li>
	<li>The Chinese Six Companies, that would later morph into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Consolidated_Benevolent_Association">Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association</a>, played an important role connecting workers to businesses in need of them, providing social services to Chinese, engaging in political advocacy. In this respect, they played roles similar to civic organizations and political advocacy organizations. However, because of their importance as middlemen between contract workers and businesses, a perception began forming that Chinese were indentured laborers who were simply puppets of these companies. This perception, based on a grain of truth, was grossly exaggerated, feeding into the myth of foreigners as exploited indentured workers (myths whose analogues exist to this day, <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/h1b.html">even for skilled H-1B workers today</a>). Henry Kittredge Norton describes it thus:

<blockquote>The Chinese who came to California were largely of this class and so described themselves on their arrival. It did not take long for the anti-Chinese agitators to define a “coolie” as a contract laborer and to describe how he was bound to a master in China to work a certain number of years at a small wage and how this terrible system was eating the very vitals out of American labor. This American labor about which there was so much concern was almost wholly composed of Irish and other European aliens who were no more American than the Chinese. But they had a vote in prospect. The Chinese did not.

While the success of the coolie fiction was largely due to the fact that there were so many who wanted to believe it, a number of circumstances combined to give it greater vitality. Most of the business transactions of the Chinese were done through their benevolent organizations which came to be locally known as the “Six Companies.” The Companies often contracted for large bodies of laborers and this fact led the unthinking to conclude that these laborers were under contract with the Six Companies to work for them as they should direct. This was not the true situation. These Companies simply acted as clearing-houses for all sorts of transactions among the Chinese, as they had found that they could handle things in a strange land more satisfactorily through such associations than they could individually.</blockquote></li>
      <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit-ticket_system">credit-ticket system</a>, where a person's travel to the United States would be paid for by a lender in exchange for a share of the person's wages for the first few months of work was, somewhat inaccurately, cast in terms of indentured servitude. This system was particularly important for recruiting Chinese to come and work on the transcontinental railroads in the 1860s, and fed into the perception of the Chinese as mindless servants. Quoting again from the link above:

<blockquote>Another thing which strengthened the coolie fiction was the manner in which the Chinese were employed on the construction work. of the Central Pacific Railroad. Because of the scarcity of labor the men in charge of this construction work had sent an agent to China to secure Chinese laborers. In order to get these men over to this country, it was necessary to advance their passage-money and other expenses. To cover this loan each Chinaman so employed signed a promissory note for $75. This note provided for monthly instalment payments running over a period of seven months and was endorsed by friends in China. Each laborer was guaranteed a wage of $35 a month. This financial arrangement was of course seized upon and made much of by the anti-Chinese agitators as the final proof of “coolieism.”

The belief that the Chinese were contract laborers was one of those unfortunate errors which sometimes became current in our civic life, and by frequent repetition receive almost universal acceptance. In the present instance this phantom of Chinese slavery became so thoroughly a part of the political life of the Pacific Coast that no attempt was made to reach the truth of the matter. Every man in public life was under so binding a necessity to accept the popular belief in regard to the Chinese and to truckle to it at every turn, that for one to seek the real truth of the matter was to end forthwith his political career.</blockquote></li>
</ul>

On the whole, looking at the nature of these complaints, I am reminded of a paragraph from Bryan Caplan's post <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/06/misanthropy_by.html">Misanthropy by Numbers</a>, that he quotes in <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/12/krikorian_again.html">Assimilation and Immigration Restriction</a>:

<blockquote>The ideal approach, though, is to twist positives into negatives.  If the maligned group is hard-working, call them "coolies" or "helots."  If they're respectful, call them "slavish" or "docile."  If they're frugal, call them "greedy" or "cheap."  If they raise property values, say "They're making housing unaffordable."  This makes lazy listeners feel like you've covered all your bases, and deprives your opponents of their best arguments.</blockquote>
